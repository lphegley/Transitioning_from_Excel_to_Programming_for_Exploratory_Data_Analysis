    "Microsoft Excel is an undoubtably useful tool for working with data. It allows users to easily see the data and understand its meaning thanks to the visual content represented in a table. While Excel isn't going anywhere, it doesn't have the flexibility or the ability to automate tasks that some programming languages allow. The beauty of Excel is the low overhead to get started with understanding data and its format. Programming languages like Python are powerful tools that build on a users prexisting knowledge of data, and give them the ability to explore their data how they choose. \n"

The jump between Excel and a language that uses code commands can be quite daunting, especially to those who have had poor experiences with trying to learn how to code.

    "Exploratory Data Analysis is all about digging into the data and looking around in it instead of jumping right into the work of data analysis with no forethought. Emphasis is placed on looking at the data through different visual models to come to an understanding of its contents. The intent is to look with an open mind at what the data is telling you, not to look for confirmation of your pre-existing hypothesises. Visaulizations should make us accept what the data contains, even if we expect or hope it to appear a certain way. Sticking to only planned analysis takes away the ability to be suprised by the contents in data. EDA is not the same as data analysis, but rather the first step in beginning the process of it.  \n",

If the library is deemed reliable enough by the programming community (evaluated on the basis of unit testing, longevity, and code clarity) then the program may become something that is widely used. There are far more libraries than the ones I will be using in my tutorial, but please be warned that you should only use a library if it comes from a person you trust, or it is accepted as safe by the programmming community.  \n",

    "[Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html) is a package (aka library) for scientific computing in Python. While it has the power to do some strong mathematical processes, it is basic enough that the general Python user shouldn't struggle too much after becoming accustomed to it. Numpy and matplotlib are both key libraries for working with data and doing math or science on them. \n",

    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/overview.html) is a Python library that helps make working with relational or labeled data easier. Pandas is one of the most commonly used packages since it works well with a variety of use cases. This includes text data, which other packages may have trouble dealing with. Pandas is known to have a bit of a harder learning curve than the other packages, but once you get the hang of it, it will be an invaluable tool."
